This page contains the documentation about the language files.

There are several languages available for BedWars1058 which are being in progress of translation for BedWars1058 Private Games Addon as well. 

Would you like to contribute to translations? [Help us translate](/private-games/contribute/help-us-translate).

The `(lang)` must be replaced with the language's shortcut that you want to access. Ex. `en`, `it`, etc.
